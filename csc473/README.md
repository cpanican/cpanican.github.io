## CSC 473 Web Design/Development Homework 3
This index.html file is used for my in class homework. Since the assignment requires us to use our personal github.io page, I made a separate directory for this activity.
[These are the requirements for this assignment..](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

## About the CSS, Images, etc. folders
Since I already made a personal site before this assignment was assigned, I re-used the same files from my personal site. They are located on the root directory of this repository.
